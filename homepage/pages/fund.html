            <h3>First thoughts</h3>
             <p> As I started watching the first lecture of CS50, I instantly realized how high-quality it is. The lecture was captivating, smooth and really interesting. and i knew I'm going to have an amazing time during the course. 
                i enjoyed learning about the basics of binary and ASCII. and how everything is made of zeros and ones. i was fascinated that how a small and basic thing can make such magnificent things.</p>

             <h3>Starting to Code</h3>
             <p>The first coding assignments were interesting because I had never coded before and it was a lot of fun to solve them. there were like puzzles and you had certain tools to work with. some were harder than others but the more I coded, the easier it got and soon enough I got a feeling for it. The first challenge was battling with syntax and trying to
                 understand which functions to use and which operations mean what. 
             </p>
             <h3>What I enjoyed the most</h3>
             <p>
                I really enjoyed the problem-solving part. I have always enjoyed puzzles, so that felt just like it. the process of trial and error, more than one way
                 to solve an issue, and logical thinking, made really interesting mental challenges. also the frustration that comes when the code is not working how you want and not knowing why. writing code in a couple of minutes and spending 
                hours debugging it. but once you figure it out. it is really satisfying  
            <p>
                <h3>Making Progress</h3>
             <p>
                After some time, things started clicking. I went from spending half a day on a problem or an assignment to getting it done in less than an hour. I got a good idea about how to deal with the problem and how to structure my programs.
                 and I also discovered how much I enjoy low-level programming. at the end of the course, 
                 I decided to make a fractal using C. I thought making that would give me a good idea 
                 about how to deal with drawing on the screen and how to use math in programming.
                  Overall it was one of the best courses I have ever taken and I do recommend it to anyone who is passionate about programming or learning.
