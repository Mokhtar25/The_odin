            <h3>First encounter</h3>
             <p> I used to hear about it even when I was not actively learning how to program.  
                     Everyone said it was easy and it was the best. So when I decided to start learning programming with Python. and I think it was a good choice. I learned by taking the course Python by CS50. The language
                      was easy and intuitive and it did not have any weird syntax so it led to a smooth learning process. I started doing small Projects and it was challenging at first to wrap my head around
                     the programming concept but I quickly understood and I started making progress. trial and error while doing assignments and projects taught me what I needed to know to manage the basics.
                     I was rather grateful to start and do everything in Python. I have heard many horror stories about the awful syntax of other languages.</p>

             <h3>getting familiar</h3>
             <p>I had fun solving logical issues and trying to figure out the best way to solve the issue. and the infinite frustrating part of writing code in 15 minutes and spending 3 hours debugging it with print functions. after some time and progressing through the course, I started to get a sense of the languages and things started to be quite easy. I made the assignments rather quickly and didn't face any issues. 
                this will quickly change when I get introduced to Object oriented programming. 
             </p>
             <h3>Object oriented programming</h3>
             <p>
                     Before the course, I have never heard of OOP. When I started working on the assignments that was after the OOP lecture. I was facing a lot of trouble. suddenly things were not so clear and I had problem with the "getters" and "setters"
                    for some reason, 
 I                  couldn't get them to work correctly. so after two days of endless frustration I manged to solve it by quite frankly a stupid solution but 
                     I didn't care I was very happy to be done with it. I said to myself i'll revisit it later and try to get a better solution. and I tried after. I had to write the whole thing over again.
            <p>
                <h3>Done with course</h3>
             <p>
                after a month of programming every day and spending hours debugging. I was happy to be done and looking forward to starting something new.
                I wanted to do a sort of Instagram bot for my final project but soon I realized Instagram is not a fan of people using third-party APIs and they kept banning my bot accounts and even banned my IP from making new accounts.
                Therefore I decided to change the direction of the project by letting the user download the data from Instagram and letting the program work it out. it was a success however I still wanna do the first version maybe at a later time point.
                learning Python is a lot of fun and there is a lot to explore from third-party libraries. and it gave a good introduction to the logic of programming. Although I'm not the biggest fan now, after learning C things started to make more sense and I fell in love with it. I do recommend Python to anyone who wants to dabble with programming.
